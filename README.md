We are happy frontend

  

## Dependencies

- node (developed with v14.16.0)

- A browser :)

  

## Setup

First, consider using the [infra project](https://github.com/revok/wah-infra) as this automates a lot of the boring stuff. 

If you're sure you want to set up locally:

- copy the env.dist file to a .env file and fill in the parameters.
- Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies
- Run ``` npm run start ``` to  start serving the application.


After that you should be able to go to localhost:8888 (default settings) to view the app.
