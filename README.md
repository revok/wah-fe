We are happy frontend

## Dependencies
- node (developed with v14.16.0)
- A browser :)

## Setup
First, consider using the [infra project](https://github.com/revok/wah-infra) as this automates a lot of the boring stuff. If you're sure you want to set up locally, copy the env.dist file to a .env file and fill in the parameters. Then run the following commands:

```
  npm install     # install dependencies.
  npm run start   # start serving the application
````

After that you should be able to go to localhost:8888 (default settings) to view the app.
